# Module 8 - SOA architecture

A service-oriented architecture (**SOA**) is an architectural pattern in computer software design in which application components provide services to other components via a communications protocol, typically over a network. The principles of service-orientation are independent of any product, vendor or technology.

SOA just makes it easier for software components over various networks to work with each other.

Web services which are built as per the SOA architecture tend to make web service more independent. The web services themselves can exchange data with each other and because of the underlying principles on which they are created, they don't need any sort of human interaction and also don't need any code modifications. It ensures that the web services on a network can interact with each other seamlessly.

You should focus on such themes:
* **SOA** overview;
* **SOA** principles;
* **SOA** patterns;
