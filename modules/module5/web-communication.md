# Module 5 - Service Communication

## REST

Representational state transfer (**REST**) is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web services. Web services that conform to the **REST** architectural style, called RESTful Web services, provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet. **RESTful** Web services allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of Web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations. Other kinds of Web services, such as SOAP Web services, expose their own arbitrary sets of operations.

You should focus on such themes:
* **REST** overview;
* **REST** resource;
* **REST** architectural constraints;
* **REST** and **HTTP**;

## gRPC

gRPC is a modern, open source remote procedure call (RPC) framework that can run anywhere. It enables client and server applications to communicate transparently, and makes it easier to build connected systems.

You should focus on such themes:
* **gRPC** overview;
* **gRPC** concepts;
* **gRPC** and **HTTP**;
* **gRPC** vs **REST**;
* **Protocol Buffers** overview;

## GraphQL

You should focus on such themes:
* **GraphQL** overview;
* **GraphQL** and **HTTP**;
* **GraphQL** vs **REST**
* **GraphQL** vs **gRPC**

GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.
