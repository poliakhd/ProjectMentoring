# Module 1 - .NET Standard compatibility

In order to write shared code and use it without paint within **.NET-based** plaforms there was introduced so called **.NET Standard** specification that is establishing uniformity in the .NET ecosystem.

**.NET Standard** enables the following key scenarios:

* Defines uniform set of BCL APIs for all .NET implementations to implement, independent of workload;
* Enables developers to produce portable libraries that are usable across .NET implementations, using this same set of APIs;
* Reduces or even eliminates conditional compilation of shared source due to .NET APIs, only for OS APIs;

Below you can find most common **.NET**-based platform that supports **.NET Standard**:
* .NET Core;
* .NET Framework; 
* Mono;
* Xamarin;
* Universal Windows Platform;
* Unity;
