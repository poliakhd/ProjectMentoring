# Module 2 - Garbage Collector

Whether you are developing for computers with one processor or several, you want your application to provide the most responsive interaction with the user, even if the application is currently doing other work. Using multiple threads of execution is one of the most powerful ways to keep your application responsive to the user and at the same time make use of the processor in between or even during user events.

You should focus on such themes:
* **Heap**, **Large Object Heap**;
* **Generations**;
* **Disposable** pattern;
