# Module 2 - LINQ

**Language-Integrated Query (LINQ)** is the name for a set of technologies based on the integration of query capabilities directly into the C# language. Traditionally, queries against data are expressed as simple strings without type checking at compile time or IntelliSense support. Furthermore, you have to learn a different query language for each type of data source: SQL databases, XML documents, various Web services, and so on. With **LINQ**, a query is a first-class language construct, just like classes, methods, events.

For a developer who writes queries, the most visible "language-integrated" part of **LINQ** is the query expression. Query expressions are written in a declarative query syntax. By using query syntax, you can perform filtering, ordering, and grouping operations on data sources with a minimum of code. You use the same basic query expression patterns to query and transform data in **SQL databases**, **ADO .NET Datasets**, **XML documents** and **streams**, and **.NET collections**.

You should focus on such themes:
* **LINQ to SQL**;
* **LINQ to Objects**;
* **Parallel LINQ;**
