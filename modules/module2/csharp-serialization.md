# Module 2 - Serialization

Serialization is the process of converting the state of an object into a form that can be persisted or transported. The complement of serialization is deserialization, which converts a stream into an object. Together, these processes allow data to be stored and transferred.

You should focus on such themes:
* **Binary** serialization;
* **XML** serialization;
* **JSON** serialization;
