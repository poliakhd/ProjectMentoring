# Module 2 - Asynchronous programming

If you have any I/O-bound needs (such as requesting data from a network or accessing a database), you'll want to utilize asynchronous programming. You could also have CPU-bound code, such as performing an expensive calculation, which is also a good scenario for writing async code.
