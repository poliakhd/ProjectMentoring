# Module 2 - Assembly

Serialization is the process of converting the state of an object into a form that can be persisted or transported. The complement of serialization is deserialization, which converts a stream into an object. Together, these processes allow data to be stored and transferred.

You should focus on such themes:
* **GAC** (Global Assembly Cache);
* **Strong-named assemblies**;
* **Disassembly tools** (ILDasm, dotPeek, etc.);
