# Module 2 - Tasks

The Task Parallel Library (TPL) is based on the concept of a task, which represents an asynchronous operation. In some ways, a task resembles a thread or ThreadPool work item, but at a higher level of abstraction. The term task parallelism refers to one or more independent tasks running concurrently.

You should focus on such themes:
* **Task Scheduler**;
* **Task Continuation**;
* **Task Cancellation**;
